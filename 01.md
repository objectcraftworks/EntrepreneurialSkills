|[CD01 - Death by Powerpoint](https://vimeo.com/76171146)|Danger of assuming you understand customer's problem already|
|[CD02- Death by Demo](https://vimeo.com/76390080)|Instead, validate your understanding of customer problem and potential solution. Look for acknowledgement|
|[CD03- Death by Demo 2](https://vimeo.com/76172223)|Don't start MVP until you understand the customer problem. Demos should reflect customer needs, desires, problems, not just yours. Demo should reflect a specific customer request for a solution|
